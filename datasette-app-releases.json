[#81](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/81)\r\n- The application **loading screen** now shows a log of what is going on. [#70](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/70)\r\n- The welcome screen now invites you to try out the application by opening interesting **example CSV files**, taking advantage of the new \"File -> Open CSV from URL...\" feature. [#91](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/91)\r\n- **.db and .csv files** can now be opened in Datasette starting from the Finder using \"Right Click -> Open With -> Datasette\". [#40](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/40)\r\n- **Recently opened** `.db` and `.csv` files can now be accessed from the new \"File -> Open Recent\" menu. Thanks, [Kapilan M](https://github.com/mnckapilan)! [#54](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/54)\r\n- A new **Debug menu** can be enabled using Datasette -> About Datasette -> Enable Debug Menu\".\r\n\r\nSee [Datasette Desktop 0.2.0: The annotated release notes](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Sep/13/datasette-desktop-2/) for more background on the new features and how they work.\r\n\r\n*If you have already installed Datasette you should delete `Datasette` from your `/Applications` folder before installing this.*"

This should be considered beta software - it may well contain bugs, and I would love to hear about any that you come across.\r\n\r\n- Install this macOS package to get a `Datasette` application which you can launch from an icon\r\n- Includes full copy of Python which stays separate from any other Python versions you may have installed\r\n- Installs the latest Datasette release the first time it runs\r\n- The application can open existing SQLite database files or read CSV files into an in-memory database\r\n- It can also create a new, empty SQLite database file and create tables in that database by importing CSV data\r\n- By default the server only accepts connections from your computer, but you can use \"File -> Access Control -> Anyone on my networks\" to make it visible to other computers on your network (or devices on your [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) network).\r\n- Datasette plugins can be installed using the \"Install Plugin\" menu item\r\n\r\nPlease add feedback and suggestions to [this discussion thread](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/discussions/67).",
